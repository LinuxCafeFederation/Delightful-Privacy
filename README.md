# Delightful Privacy [![delightful](https://codeberg.org/LinuxCafeFederation/awesome-alternatives/raw/branch/master/delightful-badge.png)](https://codeberg.org/teaserbot-labs/delightful)

This is a collection of software, operating systems, and other miscellaneous tools to help the average user fight for their privacy and security online.

## [Operating Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)

### [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)
Fedora uses Security-Enhanced Linux by default, which implements a variety of security policies, including mandatory access controls, which Fedora adopted early on. Fedora provides a hardening wrapper, and does hardening for all of its packages by using compiler features such as position-independent executable (PIE). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_operating_system))

### [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)
Pop!_OS provides full out-of-the-box support for both AMD and Nvidia GPUs. It is regarded as an easy distribution to set-up for gaming, mainly due to its built-in GPU support. Pop!_OS provides default disk encryption, streamlined window and workspace management, keyboard shortcuts for navigation as well as built in power management profiles. The latest releases also have packages that allow for easy setup for TensorFlow and CUDA. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop!_OS)

### [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
Debian is one of the oldest operating systems based on the Linux kernel. The project is coordinated over the Internet by a team of volunteers guided by the Debian Project Leader and three foundational documents: the Debian Social Contract, the Debian Constitution, and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. New distributions are updated continually, and the next candidate is released after a time-based freeze. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian)

### [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/tumbleweed) - [Rolling Release!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release)
Any user who wishes to have the newest packages that include, but are not limited to, the Linux Kernel, SAMBA, git, desktops, office applications and many other packages, will want Tumbleweed. [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/#Tumbleweed)

### **For enhanced security**

### [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/)
Qubes OS is a security-focused desktop operating system that aims to provide security through isolation. Virtualization is performed by Xen, and user environments can be based on Fedora, Debian, Whonix, and Microsoft Windows, among other operating systems. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubes_OS)

### [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/)
Tails, or The Amnesic Incognito Live System, is a security-focused Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at preserving privacy and anonymity. All its incoming and outgoing connections are forced to go through Tor, and any non-anonymous connections are blocked. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tails_(operating_system)).

### [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/)
Whonix  is a Debian GNU/Linux–based security-focused Linux distribution. It aims to provide privacy, security and anonymity on the internet. The operating system consists of two virtual machines, a "Workstation" and a Tor "Gateway", running Debian GNU/Linux. All communications are forced through the Tor network to accomplish this. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whonix)

# [Web Browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser)

## For Desktop

### [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/)
Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox)

### [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
Tor is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication. The name derived from the acronym for the original software project name "The Onion Router". Tor directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network consisting of more than seven thousand relays to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis. Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity to the user. [Wikipedia](https://en.eikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29)

### [UnGoogled-Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium)
Without signing in to a Google Account, Chromium does pretty well in terms of security and privacy. However, Chromium still has some dependency on Google web services and binaries. In addition, Google designed Chromium to be easy and intuitive for users, which means they compromise on transparency and control of internal operations.

ungoogled-chromium addresses these issues in the following ways:

- Remove all remaining background requests to any web services while building and running the browser

- Remove all code specific to Google web services

- Remove all uses of pre-made binaries from the source code, and replace them with user-provided alternatives when possible.   Disable features that inhibit control and transparency, and add or modify features that promote them (these changes will almost always require manual activation or enabling). [Github](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium)  

## For mobile

### [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/) Android Only
Bromite is a Chromium fork with ad blocking and privacy enhancements; take back your browser! [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org)

### Firefox Focus [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.focus) - [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firefox-focus-privacy-browser/id1055677337)
Firefox Focus is a free and open-source privacy-focused browser from Mozilla, available for Android and iOS. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Focus)

### [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) Browser for mobile [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.torbrowser) - [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448)
Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection
between your Internet address and the services you use. We believe Tor
is reasonably secure, but please ensure you read the instructions and
configure it properly. [Github](https://github.com/guardianproject/tor-android)

## [Email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email)

### [Tutanota](https://www.tutanota.com/)
Tutanota is an end-to-end encrypted email software and freemium hosted secure email service. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutanota)

### [Mailbox](https://mailbox.org/)
There are many ears listening on the Internet, which is why all our services require mandatory SSL/TLS-encrypted data transmission. For additional security, we also use enhanced (green) security certificates ("EV") by the independent SwissSign trust service provider from Switzerland (Check the padlock symbol in your web browser's URL field). But this is just the beginning – there is so much more that we do. [Mailbox](https://mailbox.org/)

### [Disroot](https://disroot.org)
Disroot is a decentralized cloud-based service that allows you to store your files and communicate with one another. Established by a privacy-focused organization of voulunteers, if we look at Disroot as an email provider specifically, it stands out thanks to its emphasis on security with a completly free open-source approach.
